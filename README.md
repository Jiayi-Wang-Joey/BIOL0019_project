## General information
This is the code file (in Rmarkdown format) for Jiayi Wang's final year project: Statistical and Computational Modelling of Gene Regulation in the Drosophila melanogaster Blastoderm
All analysis and figures were performed with R studio version 1.3.959. (R v3.6.2.). 

## If you want to rerun the code, please note
1. Please use the atlas.vpc file which was cleaned and only contains nuclei information.
2. Remember to change the file directory.
3. Please read the instructions in the code file very carefully. If you want to change the number of regulators or the target gene, you will need to change parameters as the code file only gives examples for certain AP stripes. 
4. Code for visulisation is at the bottom.
